# PDFReadablizer

This is a very simple applet that, when given a .pdf file, a new .pdf file with the same text content will be created in arial 12pt text. I use this alot with pdf scans that are hard to read, so I thought I would upload it here if anyone else might find it to be useful. It doesn't always translate files correctly, so be careful.

I used:

- **pypdf**: https://pypdf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html
- **fpdf**: http://www.fpdf.org/
- **tqdm**: https://tqdm.github.io/

to make this program. They did all the hard work, so all credit to these amazing programmers!

**PS**: This README.md formatting is most definitely bad practice, but I don't expect this to be taken as a serious project either haha. If I add more to this in the future, I will probably make everything look more professional. Thanks for reading.
